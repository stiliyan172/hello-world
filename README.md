# hello-world
This is my first respiratory and hopefully an endless journey in the depths of the programming languages ;-)
I am a Python junior dev with 1 year of python experience.
I am currently contributing to a project with mashine learning environment and building a model of regression analysis tryning to achieve similar result (of course as higher as possible) on my test semples and my raw data. I try to work with 20 features.
